\chapter{Results}
For this project we have chosen to use C++17 and to implement a multi-threaded program to achieve a better execution time upon the computational process using OpenMP, an open standard for parallelism for C, C++ and Fortran programs. The whole execution has been run on a cluster of $10$ \texttt{Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5430 @ 2.66GHz - 16GB RAM}. With this computational power, we have been able to perform multiple experiments by varying the $K$-fold value in the cross-validation: $2$, $3$, $5$, $10$, $20$, $50$, $150$, $300$, $750$ during a period of seven days of computation.\\
The program has been written to print all the results in a \texttt{.json} file to achieve an easier data analysis through Python. In all of the experiments, both AdaBoost and Bagging have been trained over the whole data-set with the same hyper-parameter $T$ for each iteration.\\

			\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{figs/report_k750.eps} \\
		\end{tabular}
\end{figure}
As you can see in \autoref{fig:k20}, AdaBoost is way better than Bagging and it's already possible to catch the best value for $T$, which in this case is $650$ with a test error of $0.29861$.\\
Table \autoref{tab:results} summarize all the results for all the $K$-fold experiments.
