\chapter{The Dataset}
The dataset provided contains information about forest cover types. It contains seven typologies of forests labeled from $1$ to $7$, fiftyfour features listed in \autoref{tab:fetaures} along with an identification number and a column which contains the label associated to the record.

\end{figure}
In \figurename~\ref{fig:plots} we provide four examples of labeling based only by two feature per plot. In the first row and in the first plot of the second row, the labels are well ``separated'', suggesting that some of those features could be a strong candidate for classification. The last plot, located in the bottom\-right of the image, do not separate well the seven labels, suggesting that the Horiontal distance to hydrology combined (only) with the Hillshade 9am features are not good features in order to classify with a low statistical risk.
