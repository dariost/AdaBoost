\chapter{The Dataset}
The dataset provided contains information about forest cover types. It contains seven kinds of forests labeled from $1$ to $7$, $54$ features listed in \autoref{tab:features} along with an identification number and a column which contains the label associated to the record.

\end{figure}
In \figurename~\ref{fig:plots} we provide four examples of scatter plots based on two features per plot. Figures \ref{ref:1eps}, \ref{ref:2eps} and \ref{ref:3eps}, the labels are well ``separated'', suggesting that some of those features could be a strong candidate to aid classification. Figure \ref{ref:4eps} does not separate as well the different labels, suggesting that the Horizontal distance to hydrology combined (only) with the Hillshade 9am feature are not as good features as the others.
